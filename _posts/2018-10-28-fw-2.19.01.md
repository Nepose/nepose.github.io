Hello!
A short post that you can download new image :) You can do it from GitHub or from update server (Downloads -> MAG Software Portal).

Everything I've explained at forums and at docu so I don't want to make you tired it second, if not third time ;) Just use and let me know your opinion!

There is custom signing so there are two types of images (transitional and final). Thank you for being with me!
