So maybe you are thinking "_why doing it?_" Why couldn't I still do my previous page and here store only data? Why not buying paid VPS? Now it might be more phylosophic talking than firmware post, but I'll try to explain you my deciding.

First thing was that I have looked for place where I could store big binaries and maybe source code. Repositories like GitHub, SourceForge etc. are the best place for it. I've chosen GitHub because of using Git and possibility to do changes directly from the same computer that I do firmware ;)

Also, as I have noticed here, there's a GitHub Pages tool to make simple site. This is an exactly thing that I've looked for - simple blog without any bells and rippers, just sharing you my progress. I also could have everything in one place (one repo for website and one for MAG Software Portal).

Yeah, I know that it may look like sponsored post, but it's not sponsored. Really, I guarantee you it ;) It's just my thinking about looking for place to learn developing. And finally I've found it! Here I'll do my blog, download repo and wiki. For transition time the old links will redirect to new ones:

*   [http://magportal.epizy.com](http://magportal.epizy.com) to [https://nepose.github.io](http://nepose.github.io)
*   [http://soft.magportal.epizy.com](http://soft.magportal.epizy.com) to [https://github.com/Nepose/MAG\_Software\_Portal](http://github.com/Nepose/MAG_Software_Portal)
*   [http://magportal.epizy.com/wiki](http://magportal.epizy.com/wiki) and [http://wiki.magportal.epizy.com](http://wiki.magportal.epizy.com) to [https://github.com/Nepose/MAG\_Software\_Portal/wiki](http://github.com/Nepose/MAG_Software_Portal/wiki)
*   [http://dl.magportal.epizy.com](http://dl.magportal.epizy.com) to [https://github.com/Nepose/MAG\_Software\_Portal/releases](http://github.com/Nepose/MAG_Software_Portal/releases)

Finally now the website is moving here and everything new about MAG Software Portal will be at this address. Thank you for being with me at this time! :) Of course my firmware will be continued, don't worry :) Maybe also older posts will be moved, I must think about it.
