I decided to move MAG Software Portal to place between my three other developments - Mini System Box, Simple Notepad and Polish translation for Stalker Middleware that I'll announce more later about.

So where is website of MAG Software Portal? It was supposed to be website only of that project, but together with growing working at GitHub, the website grows. This news blog will be used to post notes about all developments, not only "software for MAGs", so it will be more like typical blog ;)

There will be also created *Downloads* site where will be more information about downloading latest releases of all developments. Of course I'm going to change design of website to better and maybe make PWA basing on it. This post is too short, I know, but I can't tell you more at this moment ;) Just relax and see improving project in a moment.

And second thing that I'll post here is update for MAG Software Portal. Now I can see only that it's coming soon and I'm going to focus on improving set-top-boxes performance and more user-friendly interface so being patient is valuable. Yeah, I know that it sounds like an advert, but just wait, I'm not able to say more info. ;)

Thanks for being with me!
