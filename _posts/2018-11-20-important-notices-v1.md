## I'm publishing some new info from developing new image, please read these notices :)

### Notice for MAG 200 users
You should now be able to choose both images with 1us and 2us NAND preset from Settings -> Software autoupdate. From System Settings -> Software update still only the same NAND settings available, the opposite one can be flashed by USB method.

### Notice for MAG 255 users
I'm planning to enable possibility to unlock closed platform MAGs and convert them to Aura HD. Here it comes with MAG 255 -> Aura HD Plus. Of course it includes flashing MAG Software Portal.

### Notice for MAG 245/250 users
The program of unlocking will be also available for MAGs 245/250 to Aura HD if needed.

### Notice for MAG 256, 349/351 and 270/275 users
It is planned to start support of MAG Software Portal for your STBs so don't worry :) If you need anything let me know.

### Notice for MAGs with STM board (200, 245/250, 254, 270/275)
I'm soon going to start customizing kernel and enabling more functionality on Linux side (as normal PCs can have). I have a few ideas what to embed to firmware. If you have any ones and you want some functionality, please let me know and contact me :) Contact form and e-mail you have at top bar, I'll answer asap.

### Notice with new version 2.19.02-release
Because of signing problem detected on my computer the new firmware (v2.19.02-release) will have to be flashed through bootloader methods. Afterwards of course updating through STB settings and external portals will be available.

Thanks for meeting yourself with it :)
