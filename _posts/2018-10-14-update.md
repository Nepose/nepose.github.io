title: Finally update from portal comes!
---

Hello!
Exactly as the title announce and finally I'm able to embed updating from embedded portal! To do this, I'll use custom key from Infomir operator utilities. So the changes comes:
* the 2.19.01 image will be released in two versions:
	- **transitional**, intended to import my signing into STB with preinstalled factory firmware or older version of MAG Software Portal,
	- **final** which is the entire image.
* Next updates since 2.19.01 should be done from embedded or external portal. From embedded portal you can use options:
	- *Settings* -> *Software autoupdate*
	- *Settings* -> *System settings* -> *Software autoupdate*
* URL to update is preinstalled at STB.

So just await update and it will be last update done through Bootloader menu ;) Thanks!
