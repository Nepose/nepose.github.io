Hello!
Just a short post about two things. Firstly, the new firmware with functionality to do update through STB and set up automatically checking will come today or tomorrow. I've decided that it won't have new functionality on inner portal, this piece of cake will be released as soon as possible into new imageupdate. There should be a prompt about it on STB if you haven't changed anything, please await. ;)

And the second thing is that I'll release first revision of recovery scripts today on GitHub. It will just be a group of scripts which you can start at STB through SSH and USB to remote control device. At this moment i won't embed it into image as additional file system, maybe in next updates.

Just please be patient ;) Thank you!
